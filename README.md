django-nap
==========

A light REST library for Django.

Whilst there are many existing RESTful API tools about, many of them are very complex, and [as I found] some are quite slow!

I wanted to take the solid serialising pattern from TastyPie, with the separation of roles of django-rest-framework, and include a Publisher API I developed some time ago.

Serialiser
==========

A serialiser defines how to convert an object to/from a JSON encodable format.
