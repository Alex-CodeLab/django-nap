- Add different field types, mostly for inflating to non-trivially supported types

- Add hooks to serialiser and publisher to set default **kwargs
- Create mixin classes for ModelPublisher to provide read/update/delete patterns
    - one version that calls affects model-level validation
    - one version that uses form validation

- Provide an internal API layer that's devoid of de/serialising, and an outer layer.
This should promote re-use of the facilities.
