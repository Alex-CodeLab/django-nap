- Add hooks to serialiser and publisher to set default **kwargs

- Provide an internal API layer that's devoid of de/serialising, and an outer layer.
    This should promote re-use of the facilities.

- Shortcut syntax for nested lists/records

- Enforce not null?

- Have ModelSerialiser auto-create ModelSerialisers for ForeignKeys?
